# AdmissionPrediction
Nowadays we see a lot of students showing interest towards higher studies away from
their home countries. The main country targeted by these international students is The
United States of America. In the past decade the number of Indian students pursuing
post graduate education from the USA has rapidly increased. So, the competition for
the admission in a good university has also gradually increased. Generally, as the
students don’t have much idea about the procedures, requirements and details of the
universities in the USA they seek help from the education consultancy firms to help
them successfully secure admission in the universities which are best suitable for their
profile, for this they have to invest huge amount of money as consultancy fees. The aim
of this project is to develop a system using machine learning algorithms. It will help the
students to identify the chances of their application to the university being accepted.
Also, it will help them in identifying the universities which are best suitable for their
profile. It’s a very simple and user-friendly interface developed for the users to access
this trained system.
